Thanks for using Gakuto Deshimaru Chi (pronounced as kai)!

Voicebank Usage:
This voicebank is a CVVC with four pitches. A2, D3, G3 and C4

Some consonants have a second form notated by adding a 2 at the end of the lyric:
t = normal t, t2 = aspirated t
z = normal z, z2 = dz sound
r = Japanese r, r2 = l sound

Sometimes they're just nitpicks of mine:
hu2 = hu with an f sound / fu
hi2 = hi with a different h sound as with normal hi idk

Natural ends are notated as [x -]
Glottals are notated as [- x'], [x x'], [x -']

There are three types of end breaths:
Exhale: [x R] or [x 息]
Inhale: [x bR] or [x 吸]
Exhale then Inhale: [x Rb] or [x 息吸]
